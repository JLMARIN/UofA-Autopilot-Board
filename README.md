# UofA-Autopilot-Board
University of Alberta Autopilot Board Hardware Design

This repository holds the design files for the University of Alberta Autopilot Board, currently being used by the University of Alberta Aerial Robotics Group (UAARG).

This project was developed by Jorge Marin, Rijesh Augustine and Duncan G. Elliott, from the University of Alberta ECE department.

The current design files include both the autopilot board and the redundant power supply board inside a single file. both board are connected by a breakaway tab. The reason for keeping both boards together is for reducing manufacturing costs. They can be separted afterwards.

A user guide is also included that contains comprehensive information about the autopilot board. A similar guide for the redundant power supply board is under work right now and will be available once finished.
